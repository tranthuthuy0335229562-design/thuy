<p>
Cultural bias remains a significant obstacle in our connected world. As we enter 2025, many communities struggle with preconceptions about people from different <br>
In workplaces, cultural bias manifests when managers favor candidates who share their cultural background. In schools, students from certain cultures may face lower expectations from teachers who harbor preconceptions. Media representation perpetuates stereotypes by portraying specific groups in limited roles. These portrayals reinforce existing biases and shape public perception. Organizations that neglect cultural diversity training risk creating unwelcoming environments for employees and clients alike.<br>
Approaches to mitigate cultural bias include educational initiatives exposing people to diverse perspectives early. Technology facilitates cultural exchange through virtual reality experiences. Many corporations have implemented blind recruitment processes to eliminate discrimination. Community events celebrating different traditions help break down barriers between groups. These combined efforts are gradually shifting attitudes, though progress remains uneven across regions.<br>
The benefits of overcoming cultural bias extend beyond social harmony. Research indicates that diverse teams outperform homogeneous ones in problem-solving. Countries embracing multiculturalism often experience economic growth through increased creativity. Individuals who overcome their biases report more fulfilling relationships and broader worldviews. The challenge of confronting cultural bias requires sustained commitment from individuals, organizations, and governments working together.

Read the following passage about Christmas trees and mark the letter A, B, C, or D 
to indicate the correct answer to each of the questions.
</b></p>

<h2>CHRISTMAS TREES AND THE ENVIRONMENT</h2>

<p>
[I] The environmental impact of Christmas trees goes beyond choosing real or artificial. [II] Real trees, typically spruce, fir, or pine, are grown on plantations for about ten years, supporting biodiversity by providing habitats for farmland birds and insects. [III] These trees play a small but meaningful role in preserving rural landscapes and preventing alternative, less sustainable land uses, like urban development. [IV].
</p>

Artificial trees, while reusable, have a significantly higher carbon footprint during production and transport...
</p>

<p>
Artificial trees, while reusable, have a significantly higher carbon footprint during production and transport. According to the Carbon Trust, they must be reused for several years to match the lower carbon footprint of real trees.
</p>

<p>
Disposal methods are critical. Real trees release their stored carbon upon decay, but if they end up in landfill, anaerobic conditions produce methane, a far more potent greenhouse gas. Composting, chipping, or using trees for energy or habitat restoration are far better alternatives. Additionally, some companies now offer tree rentals, and pot-grown trees can be replanted, making them excellent sustainable options.
</p>
<p>Sustainability efforts can also include buying locally grown trees, reducing travel emissions, and supporting certified sustainable farms. While Christmas trees represent a minor part of land use and the global carbon cycle, their management highlights opportunities for improvement. Reducing waste, eliminating fertilisers, and avoiding landfill disposal are practical steps toward making this cherished tradition more eco-friendly.</p>
<p>Though a small element of the festive season, Christmas trees remind us of the broader need to balance ecological responsibility with tradition. With mindful practices, this holiday symbol can contribute positively to both biodiversity and climate goals.</p>
